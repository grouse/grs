# TODO
- [ ] [bug][memory] memory leak observed in vm_freelist_allocator
- [ ] expose WS_EX_TOPMOST as API and/or window creation flag, with appropriate window control to toggle
    - can I hook into the right-click context menu for the window titlebar and add a command there?
- [ ] figure out whether to send HOLD input events continously every frame, on change, or just when triggered
    - currently sends event on trigger, with bugs
- [ ] expand ASSERT with ASSERT_EQi/NEQf/et al. for a basic way to print the values of the expression
- [ ] fix sorting in test results, push to tail instead of push to head
- [ ] [array] move constructor overloads for array_add
- [ ] [array] move exchange for array_insert procedures that shifts existing elements
- [ ] [map] Map
- [ ] [map] FixedMap
- [ ] [assets] bring over asset APIs
- [ ] [gui] bring over GUI APIs
    - aya is furthest along, with some minor fixes and changes in mimir
    - decide whether to keep or remove the dependency on font APIs
- [ ] [font] bring over font APIs
    - need to decide whether to have a dependency on gfx for creation/updating of the font atlas texture data, or if that should be done in a more separated way
- [ ] [gfx] bring over core gfx APIs
    - rely heavily on per-game management of actual complex rendering
    - core API for management of resources, shaders, materials, etc. Aya is furthest along
- [ ] [input] lambda/function pointer mapping
    - can I do it such that I don't need to supply a mapping id? treat the function pointer as the id in some way
    - In some cases I might want to supply a function pointer but still query the input for the mapping, how to handle that if the function pointer acts as the mapping id?
- [ ] [input] multi-gamepad support
- [ ] [input] hold duration
- [ ] [input] axes deadzone
    - should this be per device? per action mapping?

# DOING

# DONE
- [x] [input] query state for AXIS input events instead of relying on awkward, complicated, and above all broken logic
    - particularly for axes bound to digital events, like keyboard keys
    - ended up instead keeping an map<InputDesc, bool> active which I can query to determine whether to reset AXIS mappings on key release
- [x] [input] query state for HOLD input events intead of relying on delta events to update them
    - ended up instead keeping an map<InputDesc, bool> active which I can query to determine whether to reset HOLD mappings on key release
